# AdvancedSideScroller

Its a practice project to test many game-play features beside each other.</br>
Certainly there are bugs and unhandled situatins as its only a test.</br>

it's a short demonstration of gameplay:   https://youtu.be/GhCNINCwEpA   </br>

The System Includes:</br>

basic character controller(walk,run crouch)</br>

aim and shoot using arm ik(pitol, rifle) </br>

foot ik in slopes</br>

vault</br>

melee</br>

grab hostage</br>

cover</br>

shooting drone(made basic AI with utility theory)</br>

enemies(basic AI with Utility Theory ) </br>

climb ladder</br>

climb horizontal rope</br>


as i had very little time and its a test project, i used some bad practices like using partial classes that i wont use in big projects
